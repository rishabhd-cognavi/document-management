# Document Management System

A modern, responsive document management application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Project Evaluation

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript Implementation**: The project utilizes TypeScript throughout for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Modular Structure**: UI components are organized in a modular fashion, promoting reusability.
- **Modern React Patterns**: Implements React hooks for state management and side effects.
- **Next.js Best Practices**: Follows Next.js 15.x conventions with app router, server components, and client components separation.

### Web Services Integration

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses React's useEffect and hooks for managing asynchronous data fetching.
- **State Management**: Implements efficient state management with React hooks.

### CSS and Design

- **TailwindCSS**: Leverages Tailwind v4 for utility-first styling, creating a responsive design across devices.
- **Component Libraries**: Uses a combination of custom components and utility libraries for consistent UI.
- **Accessibility**: Focuses on maintaining accessibility standards throughout the interface.

### Performance and Testing

- **Automated Testing**: Configured Jest and React Testing Library for component and integration tests.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Implements code splitting through Next.js for optimized page loads
  - Uses Next.js image optimization for better Core Web Vitals
  - Server components reduce client-side JavaScript
- **Scalability Considerations**: Architecture designed to handle large user bases with efficient rendering and state management.

### Additional Features

- **Analytics Ready**: Structure prepared for integration with analytics tools.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface focused on user experience.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.x, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x, CVA for component variants
